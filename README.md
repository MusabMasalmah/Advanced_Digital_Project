# Traffic Light Controller using Finite State Machine (Verilog)

## Overview

This project implements a traffic light controller using Verilog and Finite State Machine (FSM) methodology. The traffic light controller manages two roads' traffic flow, controlling the timing and sequencing of the traffic lights.

## Features

- Designed using Verilog HDL.
- Utilizes a Finite State Machine (FSM) approach for control logic.
- Supports two roads with independent traffic light sequences.
- Simple, modular design for easy integration and customization.

## How to Use

1. **Simulation**: Simulate the design using Verilog simulation tools such as ModelSim.
2. **Customization**: Modify the Verilog code to adjust timings, sequences, or add additional features as per requirements.

## Verilog Files

- `project.v`: Main Verilog module containing the traffic light controller logic and Testbench module for simulation.

## Simulation

To simulate the traffic light controller, follow these steps:

1. Compile the Verilog files including `traffic_light_controller.v` and `testbench.v`.
2. Run the simulation and observe the waveforms to verify the functionality.
